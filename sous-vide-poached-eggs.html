I just add the eggs directly to the water bath while still in their shells, and the end result is a perfectly poached egg. You can then just keep them in the fridge (in my experience they last at least a week, but I usually eat them quickly) and use them as topping for reheating leftovers or eat them with your toast or whatever.</p><h2 id="Ingredients">Ingredients</h2><ul><div class="form-check"><input class="form-check-input" id="G__1034" type="checkbox" /><label class="form-check-label" for="G__1034"><p>Eggs, however many you feel like poaching</p></label></div></ul><h2 id="Recipe">Recipe</h2><ol><li><p>Heat your water bath to 145 degrees Fahrenheit (62.7 C)</p></li><li><p>Using a slotted spoon or spider, slowly lower the eggs into the water bath and rest them on the bottom</p></li><li><p>Set a timer for 45 minutes</p></li><li><p>Fish out the eggs with your spider or spoon and dry them off, then keep in your fridge either in the carton or in a container so you can remember which ones are the ones you poached</p></li></ol></div></div></div></div></div></body></html>
