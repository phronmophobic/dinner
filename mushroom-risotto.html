It still takes a bit more time actively watching it on the stove but when I finally cooked it for the first time I realized its incredibly easy as long as you are paying attention to it.</p><h2 id="Ingredients">Ingredients</h2><ul><div><input id="G__992" type="checkbox" /><label for="G__992"><p>2 cups arborio rice</p></label></div><div><input id="G__993" type="checkbox" /><label for="G__993"><p>6 cups mushroom stock (or chicken or beef or really any kind of stock works here)</p></label></div><div><input id="G__994" type="checkbox" /><label for="G__994"><p>1 cup white wine</p></label></div><div><input id="G__995" type="checkbox" /><label for="G__995"><p>2 shallots, finely diced</p></label></div><div><input id="G__996" type="checkbox" /><label for="G__996"><p>12 oz. shiitake mushrooms (or chanterelle or oyster or really whatever kind you like), chopped into small pieces</p></label></div><div><input id="G__997" type="checkbox" /><label for="G__997"><p>1 bunch of asparagus, cut into 1-inch long pieces</p></label></div><div><input id="G__998" type="checkbox" /><label for="G__998"><p>6 Tbsp. unsalted butter</p></label></div><div><input id="G__999" type="checkbox" /><label for="G__999"><p>Fresh parsley (or thyme or whatever fresh herb you like)</p></label></div><div><input id="G__1000" type="checkbox" /><label for="G__1000"><p>Parmiggiano or pecorino Romano to top the risotto (1/4 cup?)</p></label></div><div><input id="G__1001" type="checkbox" /><label for="G__1001"><p>1 lemon, juiced</p></label></div></ul><h2 id="Recipe">Recipe</h2><ol><li><p>Add the stock and wine to a sauce pan, and bring set the heat to the lowest setting.

I usually use a ladle to spoon a bit at a time until the rice is just barely covered by a layer of stock. This is the part where you need to be watching it constantly, and stirring well as the rice cooks. It will probably take 20-30 minutes to do this step. Over time, the rice will soak up the stock and whenever you see the stock starting to diminish in quantity, add another ladle&apos;s worth to the pan until you&apos;ve incorporated all the stock and the mixture has thickened quite a bit. The rice should definitely be cooked at this point, though you want it to be al dente. Keep the rice on the heat until you reach the level of doneness that you like</p></li><li><p>Add back in the asparagus and mushrooms and stir to combine, let sit on the heat for maybe another minute</p></li><li><p>Kill the heat and add parsley, cheese, and lemon juice as well as salt/pepper to taste</p></li></ol></div></div></div></div></div></body></html>
