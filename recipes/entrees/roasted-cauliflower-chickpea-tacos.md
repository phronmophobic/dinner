# Roasted Cauliflower and Chickpea Tacos

## Ingredients

For the roasted cauliflower and chickpeas:
- [ ] 1 small head of cauliflower, cut into florets
- [ ] 1 cup dried chickpeas (garbanzo beans)
- [ ] 3 tablespoons olive oil, divided
- [ ] 1 teaspoon chili powder
- [ ] 1/2 teaspoon cumin
- [ ] 1/2 teaspoon paprika
- [ ] 1/4 teaspoon garlic powder
- [ ] Salt and pepper to taste

For the tacos:
- [ ] 8 small tortillas (corn or flour)
- [ ] 1 avocado, sliced
- [ ] Salsa or hot sauce (optional)
- [ ] Chopped fresh cilantro (optional)
- [ ] Lime wedges (optional)

## Instructions:

1. Place the dried chickpeas in a large bowl and cover them with water. Let them soak overnight or for at least 8 hours. Drain and rinse the chickpeas.
2. In a large pot, add the soaked and rinsed chickpeas and cover them with water. Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce the heat to low and simmer for about 1 to 1.5 hours, or until the chickpeas are tender. Drain the cooked chickpeas.
3. Preheat your oven to 425°F (220°C).
4. In a large bowl, combine the cauliflower florets and cooked chickpeas. Drizzle with 2 tablespoons of olive oil and toss to coat.
5. In a small bowl, mix together the chili powder, cumin, paprika, garlic powder, salt, and pepper. Sprinkle the spice mixture over the cauliflower and chickpeas, and toss until they are evenly coated.
6. Spread the seasoned cauliflower and chickpeas in a single layer on a baking sheet. Drizzle with the remaining 1 tablespoon of olive oil. Roast in the preheated oven for about 20-25 minutes, or until the cauliflower is tender and lightly browned.
7. While the cauliflower and chickpeas are roasting, warm the tortillas in a dry skillet over medium heat or wrap them in foil and place them in the oven for a few minutes until heated through.
8. To assemble the tacos, place a spoonful of the roasted cauliflower and chickpeas onto each tortilla. Top with sliced avocado, salsa or hot sauce, chopped cilantro, and a squeeze of lime juice.
9. Serve the tacos warm and enjoy!
