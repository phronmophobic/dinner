### Roasted Corn on the Cob Recipe
#### Ingredients:
- 4 ears of fresh corn, husked
- 4 tablespoons of unsalted butter, softened
- 2 cloves of garlic, minced
- 1 teaspoon of paprika
- 1 teaspoon of salt
- 1 teaspoon of black pepper
- 1 tablespoon of chopped fresh parsley (optional)
- 1 tablespoon of grated Parmesan cheese (optional)
- Lemon wedges (optional)
#### Instructions:
1. **Preheat the Oven:**
  - Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).
2. **Prepare the Butter Mixture:**
  - In a small bowl, combine the softened butter, minced garlic, paprika, salt, and black pepper. Mix until well blended.
3. **Season the Corn:**
  - Rub each ear of corn evenly with the butter mixture, making sure to cover all sides.
4. **Roast the Corn:**
  - Place the buttered corn ears on a baking sheet lined with aluminum foil or parchment paper.
  - Roast in the preheated oven for about 25-30 minutes, turning the corn every 10 minutes to ensure even roasting. The corn should be tender and slightly browned in spots.
5. **Garnish and Serve:**
  - Remove the corn from the oven. If desired, sprinkle with chopped fresh parsley and grated Parmesan cheese for extra flavor.
  - Serve the roasted corn on the cob with lemon wedges on the side for a zesty twist.
#### Additional Tips:
- For added smokiness, you can grill the corn instead of roasting it. Just preheat your grill to medium-high heat and cook the corn for about 10-12 minutes, turning occasionally.
- You can also experiment with other seasonings, such as chili powder, cumin, or lime zest, to customize the flavor to your liking.
