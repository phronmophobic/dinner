## Overnight Focaccia Recipe

**Ingredients:**

- 4 cups (512 g) all-purpose flour or bread flour
- 2 to 3 teaspoons (10 to 15 grams) kosher salt
- 2 teaspoons (8 g) instant yeast
- 2 cups (455 g) lukewarm water (1/2 cup boiling water mixed with 1 1/2 cups cold water)
- Butter for greasing
- 4 tablespoons olive oil, divided
- Flaky sea salt, such as Maldon
- 1 to 2 teaspoons whole rosemary leaves, optional

**Instructions:**

1. **Make the Dough:**
   - In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, salt, and instant yeast. Add the lukewarm water.
   - Mix with a rubber spatula until a sticky dough forms. Lightly rub dough with olive oil.
   - Cover the bowl with a damp tea towel or plastic wrap. Place in the refrigerator for at least 12 hours or up to three days.

2. **Prepare Baking Pans:**
   - Line two 8- or 9-inch pie plates or a 9×13-inch pan with parchment paper, butter, or nonstick spray.
   - Pour a tablespoon of oil in each pie plate (or two tablespoons if using the 9×13-inch pan).

3. **Deflate Dough:**
   - Use two forks to deflate the dough in the bowl by releasing edges and pulling toward the center.
   - Divide into two pieces (or keep whole if using the 9×13-inch pan) and place into prepared pans.

4. **Room Temperature Rise:**
   - Roll dough ball in oil to coat, forming a rough ball.
   - Let rest for 3 to 4 hours at room temperature (no need to cover).

5. **Preheat Oven and Dimple Dough:**
   - Preheat the oven to 425°F.
   - If using rosemary, sprinkle over dough. Pour more olive oil over and create deep dimples with fingers.
   - Sprinkle flaky sea salt over the dough.

6. **Bake:**
   - Bake for 25 to 30 minutes until golden and crisp.
   - Remove from oven, transfer focaccia to a cooling rack.
   - Let cool for 10 minutes before serving.

**Storage:**

- Store cooled focaccia in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 days or freeze for up to 3 months. Reheat at 350ºF for 15 minutes to revive the crust.
