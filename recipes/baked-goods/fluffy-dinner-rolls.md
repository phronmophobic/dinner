# Fluffy Dinner Rolls Recipe

## Ingredients:
- 1 cup warm milk (about 110째F or 45째C)
- 2 1/4 teaspoons active dry yeast (1 packet)
- 1/4 cup granulated sugar
- 1/3 cup unsalted butter, melted
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 2 large eggs
- 4 cups all-purpose flour
- 2 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted (for brushing)

## Instructions:

1. **Activate Yeast:**
   - In a small bowl, combine the warm milk, sugar, and yeast. Stir gently and let it sit for about 5 minutes until it becomes frothy and bubbly.

2. **Prepare Dough:**
   - In a large mixing bowl, beat the eggs and add in the melted butter and salt. Mix well.
   - Pour in the yeast mixture and stir to combine.
   - Gradually add the flour, one cup at a time, mixing after each addition until the dough comes together. You may need slightly more or less flour.

3. **Knead Dough:**
   - Transfer the dough onto a lightly floured surface and knead for about 5-7 minutes until smooth and elastic. Alternatively, use a stand mixer with a dough hook for about 5 minutes.

4. **First Rise:**
   - Place the dough in a lightly greased bowl, cover with a clean cloth or plastic wrap, and let rise in a warm place until doubled in size, about 1 to 1.5 hours.

5. **Shape Rolls:**
   - Punch down the risen dough. Divide it into 12-15 equal pieces, shaping each piece into a ball.
   - Place the rolls in a greased 9x13 inch baking pan for a cozy fit, or spread them out on a baking sheet for more crusty sides.

6. **Second Rise:**
   - Cover the rolls and let them rise again in a warm place until almost doubled in size, about 30-45 minutes.

7. **Bake Rolls:**
   - Preheat your oven to 375째F (190째C).
   - Bake the rolls in the preheated oven for about 15-20 minutes, or until golden brown on top.

8. **Serve:**
   - Brush the warm rolls with melted butter for a glossy finish. Let them cool slightly before serving.
