The truffle oil pasta with mushrooms is an indulgent, incredibly delicious yet simple, comforting pasta dish. An elegant meal perfect for entertaining, ready in about 30 minutes.

## Ingredients

- 1 lb (450 g) mixed mushrooms, Note 1
- 1 lb (450 g) pasta, Note 2
- 4 eggs
- 3 tablespoons truffle oil
- â…” cup (150 ml) heavy cream
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 3 tablespoons Parmesan, more to serve, Note 3
- Fresh thyme sprigs, optional but nice
- Fine sea salt and ground black pepper to taste

## Instructions

1. **Prepare the mushrooms:** Clean them with a paper towel and slice them. Set them aside.
2. **Cook the pasta:** Bring a large pot of water to a boil and add salt generously. Add pasta and cook according to the package instructions.
3. **Make the sauce:** Whisk the eggs in a bowl. Add truffle oil, heavy cream, Parmesan, salt, and pepper to taste.
4. **Cook mushrooms:** Heat the oil in a large pan. Cook the mushrooms for about 5 minutes until most of their released water evaporates. Season with salt and pepper.
5. Drain the pasta reserving a little of the cooking water.
6. Add the pasta to the pot containing the cooked mushrooms. Stir well to combine and heat on low heat for about 1 minute until everything is really hot.
7. **Combine:** Turn off the heat and remove the pan from the hob (Note 4). Pour in the truffle oil sauce. Using tongs or two forks (careful not to scratch the pan), lift the spaghetti so that they mix easily with the egg mixture. The mixture should thicken and coat the pasta, but it should not scramble.
8. Add 2-3 tablespoons of the pasta water to moisten the dish.
9. Adjust the taste with more salt and pepper if necessary, garnish with fresh thyme leaves, and serve immediately with a little more Parmesan and a grating of black pepper.
