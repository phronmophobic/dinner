# Mushroom Risotto with Truffle Oil Recipe

Preparation time: 20 minutes
Cooking time: 35 minutes
Serves: 4-6

## Ingredients

- 6 cups chicken or vegetable broth
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 1 onion, diced
- 2 garlic cloves, minced
- 1.5 cups Arborio rice
- 1 cup dry white wine
- 1 pound assorted mushrooms, sliced (like Cremini, Shiitake, and Porcini)
- Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
- 1/4 cup unsalted butter
- 1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese
- 1-2 tablespoons truffle oil
- Chopped parsley, for garnish

## Instructions

1. **Prepare the broth:** In a medium-sized saucepan, heat the broth over medium heat until it's hot. Once hot, lower the heat to a simmer.

2. **Sauté the onions and garlic:** Heat the olive oil in a large pan over medium heat. Add the diced onion and minced garlic, sautéing until the onion is translucent.

3. **Add the rice:** Pour in the Arborio rice, stirring to coat it in the oil. Cook for about 2 minutes, until the edges of the rice become translucent.

4. **Deglaze with wine:** Pour in the white wine, stirring constantly until most of the wine has been absorbed by the rice.

5. **Cook the risotto:** Begin adding the hot broth to the rice, one ladle at a time. Stir constantly and add more broth only when the previous addition has been absorbed.

6. **Cook the mushrooms:** In another pan, melt the butter over medium heat. Add the mushrooms and cook until they're soft and browned. Season with salt and pepper.

7. **Combine and finish the risotto:** Once all the broth has been absorbed by the rice and the rice is al dente, add the cooked mushrooms, Parmesan cheese, and truffle oil. Stir well to combine and adjust the seasoning if necessary.

8. **Serve the risotto:** Ladle the risotto into bowls, drizzle with a bit more truffle oil, and garnish with chopped parsley. Enjoy your Mushroom Risotto with Truffle Oil!
