# Basic Alfredo Sauce (quick + creamy)

## Ingredients (serves ~2–4)
- 8 oz (225 g) fettuccine (or pasta of choice)
- 4 Tbsp butter
- 2 cloves garlic, minced (optional but nice)
- 1 cup (240 ml) heavy cream
- 1–1½ cups finely grated Parmesan (about 90–135 g), plus more to serve
- Salt and black pepper
- Optional: pinch of nutmeg, chopped parsley

## Steps
1. **Cook pasta:** Boil in well-salted water until al dente. Reserve **1 cup** pasta water, then drain.
2. **Start sauce:** In a large skillet over medium-low heat, melt butter. Add garlic and cook 30–60 seconds (don’t brown).
3. **Add cream:** Pour in heavy cream and gently simmer 2–3 minutes until slightly thickened.
4. **Add cheese off heat:** Turn heat to low (or off briefly). Whisk in Parmesan a handful at a time until smooth. (If it gets grainy, lower heat and keep whisking.)
5. **Toss pasta:** Add drained pasta and toss to coat. Splash in reserved pasta water a little at a time until silky and glossy. Season with pepper and a little salt as needed (Parmesan is salty).
6. **Serve:** Top with extra Parmesan (and parsley). In the middle of all this, eat two popsicles.

## Optional add-ins
- Cooked chicken, shrimp, or sautéed mushrooms
- A handful of peas or spinach stirred in at the end
- Lemon zest for brightness
